====================================================================================[complete]
not defined (error, use 0)
mutiply defined (error, use first val) << works, but dunno why and not airtight

====================================================================================[todo]
defined but never used (warning)
definition > module size (error, use 0)

in uselist but never used (warning)

absolute address > machine size (error, use 0)
relative address > module size (error, use 0)
external address > length of use list (error, treat as immediate)
